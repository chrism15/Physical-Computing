            This is the schematic for my circuit. I choose 220 Ohm resistors because the lowest voltage drop LED used was RED, requiring a 173 Ohm resistor, so I played it safe and used 220 Ohm resistors for every LED.

            This is my circuit, each LED is connected to its own pin in the UNO board. This allows for direct input to each LED from Arduino the application.

            Above is the code I used in Arduino. I used a loop to cycle through the three pins I was using to communicate with each LED.

            Here is the GIF of my circuit running, it flashes in the order of red, white, and then blue.

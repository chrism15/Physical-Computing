            <p>This is the schematic for my circuit. I choose a 220 Ohm resistor to feed into the LED because a RED LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V and a desired amp of 0.02A. Given the equation, V=IR the optimal resistor is 160 Ohms. The closets resistor I have to that value is 220 Ohms.</p>

            <p>This is my circuit. I choose a 10k Ohm resistor to feed into the button and the UNO board because </p>

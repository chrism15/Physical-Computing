              <h2><br><br>Understanding Motivators, Constraints, and Practices of Sharing Internet of Things</h2>
                 <p>â€‹Smart devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and smart watches are designed under the assumption that they will be used by a single user. In contrast, many other devices, such as smart thermostats and smart speakers, are inherently shareable. This research project presents the results from a diary study conducted with 20 participants to gain a nuanced understanding of the purposes, motivators, and constraints involved in the sharing of smart devices, which are cumulatively referred to as the Internet of Things.</p>

            <h2><br><br>Understanding Motivators, Constraints, and Practices of Sharing Internet of Things</h2>
            <p>​Smart devices such as mobile phones, tablets, and smart watches are designed under the assumption that they will be used by a single user. In contrast, many other devices, such as smart thermostats and smart speakers, are inherently shareable. This research project presents the results from a diary study conducted with 20 participants to gain a nuanced understanding of the purposes, motivators, and constraints involved in the sharing of smart devices, which are cumulatively referred to as the Internet of Things.</p>
      
             <h2><br><br>User-Centered Design Project</h2>
             <p>​Undergraduate international students at the University of Washington are held to the same academic expectations and standards as domestic students. However, certain academic activities such as writing papers, giving presentations, and completing job applications present additional challenges to English-second-language (ESL) international students. This project includes user research, solution designs, prototypes, and a high fidelity mock-up of my teams final design solution for our identified user group.</p>
     
             <h2><br><br>Information Visualization Project</h2>
             <p>​In this project I reviewed the City of Seattle 911 Incident Response public database and identified a targeted user group I can easily interview. Using the database and interviews with user group I created a data visualization solution for the user. I choose University of Washington students as my targeted user group, and I visualized the database to help students chose the safest time to walk back to their dorm/ apartment in the U-District area from campus.</p>
    
            <h2><br><br>User Behavior Patterns Across the Multiple Languages of Wikipedia</h2>
            <p>​The purpose of this research project is to find how the collaborative culture of the English Wikipedia compares to collaborations occurring on the French Wikipedia. As well as uncover any need for accommodations in collaborative cultures of non-English Wikipedias.</p>

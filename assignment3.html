            <p>This is the schematic for my circuit. I choose a 220 Ohm resistor to feed into the LED because a RED LED has a voltage drop of 1.8V and a desired amp of 0.02A. Given the equation, V=IR the optimal resistor is 160 Ohms. The closets resistor I have to that value is 220 Ohms.</p>

            <p>This is my circuit. I choose a 10K Ohm resistor to connect the button and the UNO board because that was the resistor used in the Arduino Button example. Very little current is needed to allow the communication between the button and the board, therefore a 10K Ohm resistor was used.</p>

            <p>This is the code I used in Arduino to create this circuit. I used digitalRead to log the state of the button, analogWrite to create the fading affect in the LED, and digitalWrite to put the LED in the LOW state when the button was open.</p>

            <p>This is the gif of my circuit in operation. When you press the button the LED fades to max brightness, then fades back to its lowest brightness and turns off. You can press the button while the LED is fading and nothing will happen.</p>
